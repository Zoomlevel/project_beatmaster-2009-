i wrote this years ago while learning c++, coming from BASIC.
some of the code is quite cool! :)
some of it you read - and start to drink.

anyway: i didn't want it to go to waste.

short: a beat'em up with mouse and keyboard control.

ps: i failed at the artificial intelligence. had some good ideas, but then i thought:
"one cannot simulate a system that isn't understood..."

pps: i used these sound files and do not own any copyright.

1) super metroid (snes)
2) the legend of zelda - a link to the past (snes)
3) counter-strike (pc)
4) dragon - the bruce lee story (snes)
5) street fighter II (snes)
6) some baseball game (snes)
7) early windows sounds

ppps: this is basically my interpretation of the fighting style of jeet kune do.
while sitting at a computer and only moving your wrists.
